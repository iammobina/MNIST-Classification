# MNIST Classification

The repository contains three different implementations for MNIST classification with a MLP(Multilayer Perception) network and an error diagram for training and testing.

1) The first implementation uses the Keras module to implement MNIST classifier.

2) The second implementation uses drop-outs to implement MNIST classifier.

3. The third implementation does not use Keras, but instead uses Numpy and implements BP algorithm to classify MNIST
